FizzBuzz Game is a website I created with the goal of practising my JavaScript skills. The premise is simple. I wanted to create a site where you could input a number and the code would count up from 1 to *your number* while following these rules.

1. If the division of the number by 3 leaves no remainder. Say Fizz!
2. If the division of the number by 5 leaves no remainder. Say Buzz!
3. If the division of the number by both 3 and 5 leaves no remainder. Say FizzBuzz!
4. Otherwise, just say the number.
